# # Load the data
# 
# We need to load data from a file in to a Spark DataFrame.
# Each row is an observed customer, and each column contains
# attributes of that customer.
# 
# [Data from UCI data set repo, hosted by SGI](https://www.sgi.com/tech/mlc/db/churn.all)
# 
#     Fields:
# 
#     state: discrete.
#     account length: numeric.
#     area code: numeric.
#     phone number: discrete.
#     international plan: discrete.
#     voice mail plan: discrete.
#     number vmail messages: numeric.
#     total day minutes: numeric.
#     total day calls: numeric.
#     total day charge: numeric.
#     total eve minutes: numeric.
#     total eve calls: numeric.
#     total eve charge: numeric.
#     total night minutes: numeric.
#     total night calls: numeric.
#     total night charge: numeric.
#     total intl minutes: numeric.
#     total intl calls: numeric.
#     total intl charge: numeric.
#     number customer service calls: numeric.
#     churned: discrete.
# 
# 'Numeric' and 'discrete' do not adequately describe the fundamental differences in the attributes.
# 
# Area codes are considered numeric, but they a better thought of as a categorical variable. This is because attributes that are really numeric features have a reasonable concept of distance between points. Area codes do not fall into this cateogory. They can have a small distance |area_code_1 - area_code_2| but that distance doesn't correspond to a similarity in area codes.

# # Feature Visualization
# 
# The data vizualization workflow for large data sets is usually:

# * Sample data so it fits in memory on a single machine.
# * Examine single variable distributions.
# * Examine joint distributions and correlations.
# * Look for other types of relationships.

# #Feature Distributions
# 
# We want to examine the distribution of our features, so start with them one at a time.
# 
# Seaborn has a standard function called [dist()](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/generated/seaborn.distplot.html#seaborn.distplot) that allows us to easily examine the distribution of a column of a pandas dataframe or a numpy array.


get_ipython().magic(u'matplotlib inline')
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sb

sb.distplot(sample_data['number_customer_service_calls'], kde=False)


# We can examine feature differences in the distribution of our features when we condition (split) our data in whether they churned or not.
# 
# [BoxPlot docs](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/generated/seaborn.boxplot.html)


sb.boxplot(x="churned", y="number_customer_service_calls", data=sample_data)


# # Joint Distributions
# 
# Looking at joint distributions of data can also tell us a lot, particularly about redundant features. [Seaborn's PairPlot](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/generated/seaborn.pairplot.html#seaborn.pairplot) let's us look at joint distributions for many variables at once.


example_numeric_data = sample_data[["total_intl_minutes", "total_intl_calls",
                                       "total_intl_charge", "churned"]]
sb.pairplot(example_numeric_data, hue="churned")


# Clearly, there are some strong linear relationships between some variables, let's get a general impression of the correlations between variables by using [Seaborn's heatmap functionality.](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html)


corr = sample_data[["account_length", "number_vmail_messages", "total_day_minutes",
                    "total_day_calls", "total_day_charge", "total_eve_minutes",
                    "total_eve_calls", "total_eve_charge", "total_night_minutes",
                    "total_night_calls", "total_night_charge", "total_intl_minutes", 
                    "total_intl_calls", "total_intl_charge","number_customer_service_calls"]].corr()

sb.heatmap(corr)


# The heatmap shows which features we can eliminate due to high correlation. We then get the following:


reduced_numeric_cols = ["account_length", "number_vmail_messages", "total_day_calls",
                        "total_day_charge", "total_eve_calls", "total_eve_charge",
                        "total_night_calls", "total_night_charge", "total_intl_calls", 
                        "total_intl_charge","number_customer_service_calls"]


# # Build a classification model using MLLib
# 
# We want to build a predictive model.
# 
# The overall process:
# 
Image(filename="ds-for-telco/slides/model flow.png")
# Model building diagraming showing input data split into train and test data. The training data is aligned with a feature extraction and model training set, which outputs a fitter model. The testing data alignes with a feature extraction, scoring/model application, and model evaluation step

# # Feature Extraction and Model Training
# 
# We need to:
# * Code features that are not already numeric
# * Gather all features we need into a single column in the DataFrame.
# * Split labeled data into training and testing set
# * Fit the model to the training data.
# 
# ## Feature Extraction
# We need to define our input features.
# 
# [PySpark Pipeline Docs](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.5.0/api/python/pyspark.ml.html)
# 
# ## Note
# StringIndexer --> Turns string value into numerical value. I.E. below we use it to map "churned" ("yes" or "no") into numerical values and put in it colum "label".
# 
# VectorAssembler --> takes input columns and returns a vector object into output column

from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler

assembler = VectorAssembler(
    inputCols = ['intl_plan_indexed'] + reduced_numeric_cols,
    outputCol = 'features')


# # Model Training
# 
# We can now define our classifier and pipeline. With this done, we can split our labeled data in train and test sets and fit a model.
# 
# To train the decision tree, give it the feature vector column and the label column. 
# 
# Pipeline is defined by stages. Index plan column, label column, create vectors, then define the decision tree. 


from pyspark.ml import Pipeline
from pyspark.ml.classification import DecisionTreeClassifier

classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier(labelCol = 'label', featuresCol = 'features')

pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[plan_indexer, label_indexer, assembler, classifier])

(train, test) = churn_data.randomSplit([0.7, 0.3])
model = pipeline.fit(train)


# ## Model Evaluation
# 
# The most important question to ask:
#     
#     Is my predictor better than random guessing?
# 
# How do we quantify that?

# Measure the area under the ROC curve, abreviated to AUROC.
# 
# Plots True Positive Rate vs False Positive Rate for binary classification system
# 
# [More Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic)
# 
# TL;DR for AUROC:
#     * .90-1 = excellent (A)
#     * .80-.90 = good (B)
#     * .70-.80 = fair (C)
#     * .60-.70 = poor (D)
#     * .50-.60 = fail (F)
